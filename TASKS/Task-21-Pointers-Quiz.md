# What is the purpose of pointers in C programming languages?

ANSWER

Pointers are useful resources. A pointer holds the address of a variable through which the variable being pointed to can be directly manipulated. Both pointer variable and the variable being pointed to must be of the same datatype.

# What is the difference between a pointer and a regular variable in C programming languages?

ANSWER

The major difference between a regular variable and a pointer variable is that a regular variable passes data by the value stored in it while the pointer passes data by referencing the address of the variable being pointed to.

# How do you declare a pointer in C programming languages?

ANSWER

To declare a pointer in C programming language,

`datatype * pointername;`

e.g `int * ptr;`

To avoid gibberish values it is good to initialize your pointer:

`int * ptr = NULL;`

but to make it point to a variable or memory location

`int * ptr = &variablename;`

# How do you access the value stored at the memory address pointed by a pointer in C programming languages?

ANSWER

You maken use of the asterisk
e.g
```c
int * ptr = &num;
printf("%d", *ptr); // this will print the value in num;
```

# What is a null pointer in C programming languages?

ANSWER

Null pointers are pointers that have been declared but not pointing to a particular memory location or address. They are initialized with the value NULL.

---

# How do you declare pointers to pointers in C programming languages?

ANSWER

You declare pointer to pointers using double asterisks
e.g

`int **ptr;`

# What is the relationship between pointers and arrays in C programming languages?

ANSWER

The relationship between a pointer and an array is that both hold addresses to a location or memory space.
A pointer holds the address of the variable it is pointing to while the arrayname serves as a pointer to the memory space it has been allocated to keep for a particular size of element of the same datatype.

# What is dynamic memory allocation in C programming languages and how is it achieved using pointers?

ANSWER

Dynamic allocation of memory is allocating memory at the time of execution (run time). The functions `calloc() and malloc()` support allocating of dynamic memory.

---

# How do you deallocate dynamically allocated memory in C programming languages?

ANSWER

`free(variable);`
